# r-tree

This program is for a spatial data structures class. It is written in Python.

## The assignment description:

5. Write and implement an algorithm to insert an object in an R-tree of order (m, M). (60points)
1) Choose one node-splitting algorithm, e.g., quadratic-cost or linear-cost to implement and explain this algorithm.
2) Create 100 objects with unregular shapes (regular shapes include rectangles and squares). Write a code to visualize display each of these objects and its associated bounding box (display all of these objects on the same page)
3) Insert these objects, one-by-one, into a R-tree with m=3 and M=4
4) Report the number of non-leaf nodes in your final R-tree. And write a code to visualize the bounding box of each non-leaf node in the final R-tree (indicate the level of the non-leaf
nodes)

Notes:

For the code question:

a) canâ€™t just include the code from existing package or from ChatGPT or other AI tools

b) Need to provide the sources for the existing code you follow and indicate how you havemade changes.

c) need to provide comments to your code
