# kd-tree

This is a school assignment to utilize a kd-tree library of the students choice and then implement some functionality. Most students in the course chose to use Python but I wanted to use NodeJs. The library that I chose is from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kd-tree-javascript). 

The features that were required to implement were:
- Answer the question, what is the max height
- Implement a custom range function to search the tree.

More details of the implementation can be gleaned by looking at myKdTree_1.js.

## NodeJs Notes

Initialize a new node project:

```npm init```


Install an existing node project:

```npm install```
